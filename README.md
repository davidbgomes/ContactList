# Contact List

## Overview

This is a little React.js Project I made to show my skills in front-end and back-end.
It's a Contact List where you manage your contacts from a JSON style database.

### It has Authentication, used firebase for handling that, which can be used with the following credentials:
Email: contact-list-cris_ronaldo@gmail.com
Password: ronaldo

With that you become the best football player in the world, at least in my app :)
You can sese how many people have seen your page, and edit your phone number and city in the Dashboard.

In the Contact Details you can see the contact's photos, as well as his/hers details and google maps location.

Thanks!
