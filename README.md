# Contact List

## Overview

This is a little React.js Project I made. It's a Contact List where you manage your contacts from a JSON style database.

In this project I've implemented Authentication with Firebase, created search filters to return your favourite contact as well as a cool Sign-in page and useful Dashboard.

### Url: https://contact-list-bc111.web.app/

### User sign in credentials:
Email: contact-list-cris_ronaldo@gmail.com <br />
Password: ronaldo

With that you become the best football player in the world, at least in my app :) <br />
You can check how many people have seen your page, and edit your phone number and city in the Dashboard.

In the Contact Details you can see the contact's photos, as well as his/hers details and google maps location.
